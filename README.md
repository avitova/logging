Some code in `splunk` was borrowed from https://github.com/osbuild/osbuild-composer and some code in `slogecho` is from https://github.com/samber/slog-echo - thank you.

## TODO

* Span ID must be struct (array of bytes, fixed length) with parent.child structure. Currently it concatenates the whole call stack which is dangerous and ineffective.
* Echo logging proxy.
*Â Tracing must be off by default.
* Add stdlib middleware and rename slogecho to strcware
* Fix tests.
* Rebuild examples in READMEs.
